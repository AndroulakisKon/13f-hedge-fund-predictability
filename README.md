Hedge Fund Excess Performance Prediction Using Portfolio and Macro Features

--> Overview

This project evaluates whether next-quarter excess returns of hedge funds can be predicted using portfolio characteristics extracted from 13F filings and macroeconomic variables.

Two datasets are used:

model_dataset

model_dataset_transformed --> Transformed dataset with log-scaled size variables and squared concentration/sector metrics

Four models are compared: OLS, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest.

The goal is purely predictive: evaluate out-of-sample performance using R² and RMSE.

--> Data Sources

13F Holdings: Exported from WhaleWisdom, cleaned and aggregated to fund–quarter level.

Macro + S&P 500: Pulled from Yahoo Finance and stored locally as macro_sp500_quarterly.csv for reproducibility.

All processed datasets required for modeling are already included.

--> Setup

Create the environment:

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate hedgefund_project

--> Key Findings (Short Summary)

Predictability is low: All models yield negative out-of-sample R², consistent with academic literature on 13F-based forecasting.

Ridge performs best: Regularization improves stability and slightly reduces RMSE.

Lasso shrinks most variables to zero: Indicates weak linear predictive signals.

Random Forest underperforms: Nonlinear models struggle with high noise and limited sample size.

Overall, while some features exhibit mild structure, public 13F filings and standard macro variables offer limited forward-looking predictive power for hedge fund excess returns.

Note: Raw data is intentionally excluded. The project runs using the processed
datasets provided in `data/processed/`.
