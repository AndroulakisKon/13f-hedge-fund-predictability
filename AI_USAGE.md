AI Tools Used

ChatGPT (Codex)

Purpose

AI tools were used strictly as learning aids and development support, in line with the course AI Tools Policy. They were not used to autonomously design the project, write the full codebase, or make empirical decisions.

How AI Tools Were Used (Good Uses)
1. Project structure and initial understanding

At the beginning of the project, ChatGPT (Codex) was used to:

Help understand the basic concepts required for an empirical machine learning project (data pipeline, model comparison, evaluation).

Assist in designing a clean and modular project structure (entry-point script, separation between data loading, modeling, and evaluation).

This support helped translate course concepts into a practical and organized codebase.

2. Data aggregation and merging verification

During the data construction phase, AI tools were used to:

Confirm that tables were aggregated correctly (e.g., fund–quarter level construction).

Verify that merge operations across multiple datasets used correct keys, time alignment, and consistent indexing.

Check for potential logical issues such as duplicated observations, misaligned time periods, or incorrect joins.

AI tools were used as a sanity check, not as a substitute for understanding or decision-making.

3. Validation of calculations and implementation

AI assistance was used to:

Verify that key calculations (portfolio-level aggregations, transformations, evaluation metrics) were implemented correctly.

Reduce the risk of coding mistakes in a complex empirical pipeline.

Confirm that the overall workflow was consistent with the project’s research question and methodological goals.

4. General guidance and confirmation

Throughout the project, ChatGPT and Codex were used to:

Confirm that the project remained aligned with the intended empirical finance theme.

Provide reassurance that the chosen modeling and evaluation approach was reasonable and consistent with best practices.
